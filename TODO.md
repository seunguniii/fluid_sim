TODO
---
- Needs optimization
  - clean recursive loops
  - faster painting method
  - clean code altogether
- UIController.pde
  - simulate nozzle and finned circle with UI
  - add menu for color grading
  - variable graph plots
- boundary conditions
    - outlet
      - cavities form at outlet corners
    - walls
- periodic boundaries
  - revise so it works
- add streamlines
- cleaner countours
- accurate variable names
  - rho is used for pressure, might cause confusion
---
Hard stuffs
---
- somehow implement compressive flow
- D3Q27

Updates
---
- Jan 2026
  - Refactored code to be more object oriented and have less static variables/methods
  - Added Simulation, Obstacle, UIState class
  - Renamed Paint class to Renderer
  - Renamed Update class to SimulationSolver
  - Renamed UI class to UIController
  - Renamed Object class to ObstacleBuilder
  - Updated outlet condition, applied to three boundaries
  - Updated wind tunnel condition, applied only to inlet
  - Deleted Vector class, used PVector
  - Need to finish implementing all UI functions
    - choose countour, vector field rendering
    - add airfoil for simulation obstacle
    - add periodic flow
    - add iterations per frame
